This is a simple Web Server where you can recive json points from a webserver and it when then make a make with them and connect the dots. Points.js is where all the data is stored. Main.js is all the main reading and drawing code. I am using an Adafruit Feather RP2040 and a stema QT GPS Module. The microcontroller takes the data and then sends it over serial to mainReader.py whitch then saves the data to points.json
